# thirdExerciseWithJs
## What I did 🚀

This is my third exercise learning JavaScript. <br/>
Using the contents developed in the unit I saw about on DOM, I carried out the following actions: <br/>
1-Apply background color # fcf79f to the entire document <br/>
2- Apply background color # 0ca001 -green- to all paragraphs (using p tag) <br/>
3-I increased the font size to 24px, only the element with id = "featured" <br/>
4- I changed the font family to Arial to titles (h2) <br/>
5-Link with reference: https://www.lipsum.com
